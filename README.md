# Simple-Productivity-App

7/30:

- Operates in Terminal window, executable via shell script and based json-formatted list of tasks and minutes per task (tasks.json file).
- Displays local time of upcoming tasks, time previous tasks were completed, and minutes remaining for current task. Color and blinking added for better visual.

Future:

1. Add ability to enter tasks and minutes for the day (instead of hard-coding json)
2. Create default schedules that user can setup and choose to run (e.g. '2hr intense focus', '4hr lecture review', etc)
